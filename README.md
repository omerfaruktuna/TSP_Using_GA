Solving Traveling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm

Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):Â 

Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits
every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

One strategy for solving the traveling salesman problem is to use Genetic Algorithms.

In this program, I used Genetic Algorithms to solve TSP.

This program is written and tested in Python 3.6

You should run main.py file

Below files should be in the same directory with main.py file

djibouti.txt
western-sahara.txt
us-states.txt
qatar.txt
uruguay.txt

When you run the program, program asks you to enter the file name:

You should enter the exact name of the file as input like:

djibouti.txt or western-sahara.txt

Then, program asks you where you want to start the travel, that is starting city.

You can write the number of the city like 1 or 3 or 5 or whatever the city number you chose.

But if there are 40 cities in the file, you shouldn't enter 50 for example.

Then programs start the evaluation and for each generation, it prompts minimum distance.

It is generating 500 generations and then it shows the path for the minimum distance

Finally it shows the graph of minimum distances for each generation

In Report file, you can see the output graphs.
